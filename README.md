A small tool that grabs a card pack from https://decks.rereadgames.com/ and saves it to an image file in the cards directory. It was created for myself to print out the cards.

!!!!
Create a folder "Cards" where you place the exe file. I need to figure out why it's not created when running outside of editor.
